<blockquote>
In this course, students will learn the methodology behind experimental research in computer science. The course will cover topics such as planning a new research project, designing experiments, enabling repeatable research, and effectively presenting your results. It will also provide practice with the four skills critical to being an effective researcher: reading, writing, speaking, and thinking creatively.

*Note that the course material and plans are subject to change!*
</blockquote>

## Textbook
There is no required textbook for the course.  The instructor will provide a set of books and online resources.

## Requirements
*Registration is restricted to CS Ph.D. students*, but some masters or undergraduate students actively engaged in a research project will be allowed to take the course with the approval of their research advisor and the instructor. Students must be involved in a research project before the start of the course.  *New Ph.D. students are particularly encouraged to take the course.* Ph.D. students from related disciplines in SEAS may be considered if space allows.

## Topics
The course will cover topics such as:
  - Reading technical papers
  - Proposing a project
  - Experiment design
  - Data processing, visualization, and statistics
  - Writing short and long documents
  - Giving short and long oral presentations

## Assignments
The course will not include any exams. Students will be expected to practice reading and writing, both within and outside of their field. Students will be expected to make progress on a research project throughout the semester, and will give a final writeup and presentation.  A large part of your grade will be based on class participation!

## Academic Honesty
All work submitted must be your own. *This is especially important for written assignments* -- you may **NOT** submit text copy and pasted from any other source!  Don't do it! Ever!

### Illness and Absence Policy
The instructors understand that students may need to be absent from class either due to illness or other personal situations. For personal situations such as being in a difficult time zone, internet connectivity issues, etc., students can watch lectures asynchronously and are still expected to participate via other means such as the course message board. 

If students anticipate missing several classes such as due to illness, they should alert the instructor as soon as possible.

### Academic Integrity Code
Academic Integrity is an integral part of the educational process, and GW takes these matters very seriously. Violations of academic integrity occur when students fail to cite research sources properly, engage in unauthorized collaboration, falsify data, and in other ways outlined in the Code of Academic Integrity. Students accused of academic integrity violations should contact the Office of Academic Integrity to learn more about their rights and options in the process. Outcomes can range from failure of assignment to expulsion from the University, including a transcript notation. The Office of Academic Integrity maintains a permanent record of the violation.
