> If you are already involved in a research project, then the topic of your project should be identical to the research you are already doing (e.g., for your PhD research topic). It is also understood that your topic may change over the course of the semester -- this is fine. You should write your reports based on the current topic you are working on and do not need to go back to modify prior reports unless noted.

## Project Overview
Describe your research project
  - What is the problem you will look at?
  - How do you plan to solve it?
  - Why is the problem important and why will your solution be better than other options?

Total length: ~3 paragraphs, at most 1 page
  - Bring to class or email in PDF format
  - Suggestion: use latex (possibly [www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com))

**Due:** September 6th in class


## Literature Survey
Doing a literature survey ensures you understand the state of the art work in your problem area and helps identify common issues and opportunities that can motivate your work.

Carefully read *N* papers related to your project
  - 1 < N < 6 - your choice based on where you are in your project

For each paper:
  - Describe the paper - 1 paragraph 
  - List strengths and weaknesses - bullet points with 1-2 sentences each
  - Describe how this work relates to your project/problem

PhD students: Write 1 paragraph on how you will organize papers and track your bibliography. One option is [Zotero](https://zotero.org), but you should pick something you will seriously commit to using so check with others in your research group to see if there is already a normal approach.

**Submission:** [Upload a PDF here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/O4wUzSbyWbF7zM8xPHHD). You do not need to bring a copy to class.

**Due:** Tuesday Oct 5th 11:59PM

## Experimental Design
Having a clear experimental design gives structure to your investigation. Having a set of hypotheses to evaluate ensures your solution is robust and by predicting preliminary results you can more easily "sanity check" your experiments to be sure they are behaving correctly.

This report will be formulated as a set of slides giving details of experiments you plan to run. [You must use this slide template as a base.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cdskAnKXmTG-PLSACwt1FlmrOx2G0fbC2G7Al-wJKK4/edit?usp=sharing) From the File menu choose "Make a Copy" and then fill in the slides, or export them to power point. After modifying them you will submit a PDF.

Plan *N* experiments that will help you understand the problem you are looking at, or your solution.
  - 1 < N < 5 - your choice based on where you are in your project

For each experiment (see Speaker Notes in template for more details):
  - Slide 1 contains: the goal of your experiment, a brief description of how you will run it, and a list of approaches/variations you will use as a comparison.
  - Slide 2 contains: A hypothesis describing what behavior you expect to see, a list of metrics that you will analyze to understand the results, and 1 or more graph sketches that illustrate how you expect those metrics to behave.

The experimental plans in this document do not limit what you evaluate over the coming weeksâ€“you are free to modify your design based on what you discover.
