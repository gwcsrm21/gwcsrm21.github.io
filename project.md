## Literature Survey
Carefully read N papers related to your project

For each paper:
  - Describe the paper - 1 paragraph 
  - List strengths and weaknesses - bullet points with 1-2 sentences each
  - Describe how this work relates to your project/problem

PhD students: Write 1 paragraph on how you will organize papers and track your bibliography. One option is [Zotero](https://zotero.org), but you should pick something you will seriously commit to using so check with others in your research group to see if there is already a normal approach.

Submission: [Upload a PDF here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/O4wUzSbyWbF7zM8xPHHD). You do not need to bring a copy to class.
